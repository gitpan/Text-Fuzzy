=head1 NAME

Text::Fuzzy - partial or fuzzy string matching using edit distances

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Fuzzy;
    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('boboon');
    print "Distance is ", $tf->distance ('babboon'), "\n";
    # Prints "Distance is 2"
    my @words = qw/the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog/;
    my $nearest = $tf->nearest (\@words);
    print "Nearest array entry is ", $words[$nearest], "\n";
    # Prints "Nearest array entry is brown"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module calculates the Levenshtein edit distance between words,
and does edit-distance-based searching of arrays and files to find the
nearest entry. It can handle either byte strings or character strings
(strings containing Unicode), treating each Unicode character as a
single entity.

It is designed for high performance in searching for the nearest to a
particular search term over an array of words or a file, by reducing
the number of calculations which needs to be performed.

It supports either bytewise edit distances or Unicode-based edit distances:

    use utf8;
    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('あいうえお☺');
    print $tf->distance ('うえお☺'), "\n";
    # prints "2".

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('bibbety bobbety boo');

Create a new Text::Fuzzy object from the supplied word.

=head2 distance

    my $dist = $tf->distance ($word);

Return the edit distance to C<$word> from the word used to create the
object in L</new>.

=head2 nearest

    my $index = $tf->nearest (\@words);

Return the index of the nearest element in the array to the argument
to L</new>. If none of the elements are less than the maximum distance
away from the word, C<$index> is the undefined value. It may
legitimately also be zero, so check it using C<defined>:

    if (defined $index) {
        print "Found at $index.\n";
    }

and not using C<if ($index)>.

=head2 last_distance

    my $last_distance = $tf->last_distance ();

The distance from the previous match. This is usually used in
conjunction with C</nearest> to find the edit distance to the previous
match.

=head2 get_max_distance

    # Get the maximum edit distance.
    print "The max distance is ", $tf->get_max_distance (), "\n";

Get the maximum edit distance of C<$tf>. The default is set to 10.

=head2 set_max_distance

    # Set the max distance.
    $tf->set_max_distance (3);

Set the maximum edit distance of C<$tf>. The default is set to 10. If
this is called with an undefined value, the maximum edit distance is
switched off.

=head2 scan_file

    $tf->scan_file ('/usr/share/dict/words');

Scan a file to find the nearest match to the word used in
L</new>. This assumes that the file contains lines of text separated
by newlines and finds the closest match in the file.

This does not currently support Unicode-encoded files.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 misspelt-web-page.cgi

The file F<examples/misspelt-web-page.cgi> is an example of a CGI
script which does something similar to the Apache mod_speling module,
offering spelling corrections for mistyped URLs and sending the user
to a correct page.

See the file in the distribution for details. See also
L<http://www.lemoda.net/perl/perl-mod-speling/> for how to set up
F<.htaccess> to use the script.

=head2 spell-check.pl

The file F<examples/spell-check.pl> is a spell checker. It uses a
dictionary of words specified by a command-line option "-d":

    spell-check.pl -d /usr/dict/words file1.txt file2.txt

It prints out any words which look like spelling mistakes, using the
dictionary.

Because the usual Unix dictionary doesn't have plurals, it uses
L<Lingua::EN::PluralToSingular>, to convert nouns into singular
forms. Unfortunately it still misses past participles and past tenses
of verbs.
