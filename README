This is the README for Text::Fuzzy version 0.15_01.

Text::Fuzzy is a "module" for the Perl computer programming language, a library
of computer code to install on a computer.  This document contains four
sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Text::Fuzzy - partial or fuzzy string matching using edit distances

This module calculates edit distances between words, and searches
arrays and files to find the nearest entry by edit distance. It
handles both byte strings and character strings (strings containing
Unicode), treating each Unicode character as a single entity.

    
    use Text::Fuzzy;
    use utf8;
    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('あいうえお☺');
    print $tf->distance ('うえお☺'), "\n";
    # prints "2".
    


The default is the Levenshtein edit distance, which applies an equal
weight of one to additions ("cat" -> "cart"), substitutions ("cat"
-> "cut"), and deletions ("carp" -> "cap"). The Damerau-Levenshtein
edit distance, which allows transpositions ("salt" -> "slat") may
also be selected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
